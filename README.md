asyncio.run(rebuild_user_index())
```

## Smart Property Recommendations

The Smart Property Recommendations feature transforms the chatbot from a reactive Q&A system into a proactive, intelligent property recommendation engine. It uses natural language processing, user context analysis, and conversational AI to provide personalized property suggestions.

### How It Works

1. **Intent Detection**: Automatically detects when users request property recommendations using natural language phrases like:
   - "Suggest me a property"
   - "Find me an apartment"
   - "Any good listings for me?"
   - "What properties do you have?"

2. **User Context Analysis**: Analyzes user history and preferences including:
   - Budget range and price preferences
   - Location preferences (neighborhoods, areas)
   - Required features (parking, gym, kitchen type, etc.)
   - Property type preferences (apartment, studio, loft)
   - Size requirements (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage)

3. **Conversational Clarification**: Asks targeted clarifying questions to gather missing preferences:
   - References previous conversations: "Are you still looking for places with a chef's kitchen?"
   - Asks essential questions for new users: "What's your budget range for monthly rent?"
   - Limits questions to 2-3 focused inquiries to avoid overwhelming users

4. **Personalized Recommendations**: Generates 2-3 tailored property recommendations with:
   - Detailed explanations referencing user preferences
   - Match scores based on multiple criteria
   - Specific reasons why each property fits their needs

### Example Conversation Flow

```
User: "Suggest me a property"

Bot: "I'd love to help you find the perfect property! Based on our previous 
     conversations, I see you were interested in places with modern kitchens. 
     Has your budget changed since our last chat?"

User: "My budget is around $3000 per month"

Bot: "Perfect! And are you still looking for places in the downtown area?"

User: "Yes, and parking is really important to me"

Bot: "Based on your preferences, here are my top recommendations:

     **1. 45 Pearl Street**
     ‚Ä¢ Rent: $2,850/month
     ‚Ä¢ This apartment has the modern kitchen you mentioned wanting, and it's 
       in your preferred downtown area. At $2,850/month, it fits perfectly 
       within your budget, and the building includes parking.

     **2. 123 Broadway**
     ‚Ä¢ Rent: $2,950/month  
     ‚Ä¢ This property matches your downtown location preference and includes 
       the parking you need. The kitchen was recently renovated with 
       stainless steel appliances.

     **3. 67 Main Street**
     ‚Ä¢ Rent: $2,750/month
     ‚Ä¢ Great value in downtown with dedicated parking spots. The unit 
       features an updated kitchen and is well within your budget range.

     Would you like more details about any of these properties or help 
     with scheduling a viewing?"
```
