# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current chatbot system has significant performance and response quality issues. Simple greetings like "hi" take over 54 seconds to process and return inappropriate property search responses instead of natural conversational replies. The system is rebuilding user indices on every request and failing to properly detect basic conversational intents, leading to poor user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to respond to simple greetings quickly and appropriately, so that I have a natural conversation experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a greeting message (hi, hello, hey, good morning, etc.) THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a user sends a greeting message THEN the system SHALL respond with an appropriate conversational greeting, not property search results
3. WHEN a user sends a greeting message THEN the system SHALL not trigger property search or recommendation workflows
4. IF a greeting is detected THEN the system SHALL respond with a friendly acknowledgment and offer to help with property searches

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to avoid unnecessary processing delays, so that all my interactions are responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends any message THEN the system SHALL complete processing within 5 seconds for 95% of requests
2. WHEN a user has an existing valid index THEN the system SHALL not rebuild the index unnecessarily
3. IF index rebuilding is required THEN the system SHALL do it asynchronously without blocking the user's current request
4. WHEN intent detection fails THEN the system SHALL have a fast fallback that doesn't trigger expensive operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to properly understand different types of messages, so that I get relevant responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a conversational message (greetings, thanks, etc.) THEN the system SHALL classify it as conversational, not property-related
2. WHEN a user sends a property search query THEN the system SHALL properly detect the property intent
3. IF intent detection fails due to technical errors THEN the system SHALL log the error and use rule-based fallback detection
4. WHEN using fallback intent detection THEN the system SHALL still provide appropriate responses based on message content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor chatbot performance, so that I can identify and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any request takes longer than 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL log a performance warning with timing details
2. WHEN index rebuilding occurs THEN the system SHALL log the reason and duration
3. WHEN intent detection fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific error and fallback action taken
4. IF response generation uses fallback mode THEN the system SHALL log the reason and context quality metrics
