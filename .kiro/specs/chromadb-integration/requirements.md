# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate ChromaDB as the persistent vector store for the Okada Leasing Agent's RAG system. Currently, the application uses an in-memory VectorStoreIndex that gets rebuilt on each startup. ChromaDB will provide persistent storage, better performance, and more advanced vector search capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the RAG system to use ChromaDB for persistent vector storage, so that document indexes are preserved between application restarts and provide better performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to a ChromaDB instance
2. WHEN documents are indexed THEN the system SHALL store vectors in ChromaDB collections
3. WHEN the application restarts THEN the system SHALL retrieve existing vectors from ChromaDB without re-indexing
4. WHEN a user uploads new documents THEN the system SHALL add new vectors to the existing ChromaDB collection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my uploaded documents to be stored persistently in ChromaDB, so that I don't lose my indexed data when the system restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a CSV file THEN the system SHALL create or update a user-specific ChromaDB collection
2. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL store document metadata alongside vectors in ChromaDB
3. WHEN the system performs searches THEN the system SHALL query ChromaDB collections for relevant vectors
4. WHEN a user's documents are deleted THEN the system SHALL remove the corresponding vectors from ChromaDB

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ChromaDB to be configurable for different environments, so that I can use different storage backends for development, testing, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is configured THEN the system SHALL support both persistent file-based and in-memory ChromaDB modes
2. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL use a local ChromaDB instance with file persistence
3. WHEN environment variables are set THEN the system SHALL connect to remote ChromaDB instances if configured
4. WHEN ChromaDB connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the search functionality to work seamlessly with ChromaDB, so that I get the same or better search results compared to the current implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing hybrid search THEN the system SHALL combine ChromaDB vector search with BM25 keyword search
2. WHEN filtering by metadata THEN the system SHALL use ChromaDB's metadata filtering capabilities
3. WHEN ranking properties THEN the system SHALL leverage ChromaDB's similarity scoring
4. WHEN search performance is measured THEN ChromaDB SHALL provide equal or better response times than the current in-memory solution
