# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Smart Property Recommendations feature transforms the chatbot from providing static responses to creating an intelligent, interactive property recommendation workflow. When users request property suggestions using natural language, the system will leverage both the property database and user history to provide personalized, contextual recommendations through a conversational flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a property seeker, I want to trigger personalized property recommendations using natural language prompts, so that I can get relevant suggestions without having to specify detailed search criteria upfront.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs natural language prompts like "Suggest me a property", "Find me an apartment", or "Any listings for me?" THEN the system SHALL recognize these as recommendation triggers
2. WHEN a recommendation trigger is detected THEN the system SHALL initiate the smart recommendation workflow instead of providing generic responses
3. WHEN the workflow is initiated THEN the system SHALL access both the property database and user's historical data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a property seeker, I want the chatbot to ask clarifying questions based on my history, so that I can refine my preferences without repeating information I've already provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the recommendation workflow starts THEN the system SHALL analyze the user's historical preferences and interactions
2. IF the user has previous preferences stored THEN the system SHALL ask targeted clarifying questions like "Are you still looking for places with a chef's kitchen?" or "Has your budget changed since our last chat?"
3. IF the user has no previous history THEN the system SHALL ask essential preference questions about location, budget, and key features
4. WHEN asking clarifying questions THEN the system SHALL limit to 2-3 focused questions to avoid overwhelming the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a property seeker, I want to receive 2-3 personalized property recommendations with explanations, so that I understand why each property matches my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system has gathered sufficient user context THEN it SHALL retrieve 2-3 relevant properties from the database using RAG
2. WHEN presenting recommendations THEN the system SHALL provide a brief explanation for each property match
3. WHEN explaining matches THEN the system SHALL reference specific user preferences like "This apartment has a newly renovated kitchen and is under your budget. You mentioned liking big kitchens last time."
4. WHEN no suitable matches are found THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest broadening search criteria

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a property seeker, I want my preferences and interactions to be remembered for future recommendations, so that the system becomes more accurate over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides new preference information THEN the system SHALL store this data in their CRM profile
2. WHEN a user shows interest in specific properties THEN the system SHALL update their preference profile accordingly
3. WHEN generating future recommendations THEN the system SHALL incorporate both historical and newly provided preferences
4. WHEN user preferences conflict with historical data THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recent information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a property seeker, I want the recommendation process to feel natural and conversational, so that I have a pleasant user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN engaging in the recommendation workflow THEN the system SHALL maintain a conversational tone throughout
2. WHEN asking clarifying questions THEN the system SHALL phrase them naturally rather than as form fields
3. WHEN the user provides unclear or incomplete responses THEN the system SHALL ask follow-up questions politely
4. WHEN the recommendation process is complete THEN the system SHALL offer to help with additional questions or next steps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the recommendation system to integrate seamlessly with existing RAG and CRM functionality, so that it leverages current data sources without disrupting existing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the recommendation system accesses property data THEN it SHALL use the existing RAG implementation
2. WHEN the system retrieves user history THEN it SHALL use the existing CRM integration
3. WHEN the recommendation workflow is active THEN it SHALL not interfere with other chatbot functionalities
4. WHEN errors occur during the recommendation process THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to standard chatbot responses
