# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on auditing, optimizing, and ensuring proper integration of MongoDB with the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system and chatbot functionality. The goal is to verify that MongoDB is properly configured, highly optimized for performance, correctly storing all necessary data, and seamlessly supporting the RAG pipeline and chatbot operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to audit the current MongoDB configuration and performance, so that I can identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs a MongoDB health check THEN it SHALL report connection status, database size, and collection statistics
2. WHEN analyzing query performance THEN the system SHALL identify slow queries and suggest index optimizations
3. WHEN reviewing storage efficiency THEN the system SHALL report disk usage, compression ratios, and storage optimization opportunities
4. IF MongoDB performance metrics exceed defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and recommendations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all RAG-related data is properly stored and indexed in MongoDB, so that retrieval operations are fast and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing document embeddings THEN MongoDB SHALL maintain proper vector indexing for similarity searches
2. WHEN retrieving documents for RAG THEN the system SHALL return results within acceptable latency thresholds (< 100ms for simple queries)
3. WHEN updating document collections THEN MongoDB SHALL maintain data consistency and proper versioning
4. IF document retrieval fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logging and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a chatbot user, I want the system to quickly access conversation history and context from MongoDB, so that my interactions are seamless and contextually aware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieving conversation history THEN MongoDB SHALL return user context within 50ms
2. WHEN storing new conversation data THEN the system SHALL maintain proper indexing on user_id, timestamp, and conversation_id
3. WHEN accessing user preferences and settings THEN MongoDB SHALL provide consistent read/write operations
4. IF conversation data becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL detect and repair inconsistencies automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want MongoDB to be optimized for concurrent RAG operations and chatbot interactions, so that the system can handle multiple users efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling concurrent read operations THEN MongoDB SHALL maintain sub-100ms response times under normal load
2. WHEN processing multiple RAG queries simultaneously THEN the system SHALL utilize connection pooling and query optimization
3. WHEN scaling under increased load THEN MongoDB SHALL support horizontal scaling patterns
4. IF connection limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement proper connection management and queuing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging of MongoDB operations, so that I can track performance trends and identify issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MongoDB operations occur THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics, query patterns, and error rates
2. WHEN analyzing system health THEN monitoring SHALL provide real-time dashboards for key MongoDB metrics
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically alert administrators with actionable insights
4. IF data integrity issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide detailed audit trails and recovery options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to ensure MongoDB access is properly secured and compliant with data protection requirements, so that sensitive user data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing MongoDB THEN all connections SHALL use encrypted authentication and authorization
2. WHEN storing user data THEN sensitive information SHALL be properly encrypted at rest
3. WHEN auditing access patterns THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive access logs
4. IF unauthorized access is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately alert security teams and block suspicious connections
