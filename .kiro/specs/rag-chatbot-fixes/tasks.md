# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix fusion retriever creation issue


  - Debug why get_fusion_retriever() returns None for user "ok@gmail.com"
  - Add validation checks for user_index and user_bm25_retrievers existence
  - Implement proper error handling when retrievers cannot be created
  - Add logging to track retriever creation process
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1_

- [x] 2. Implement automatic index building with validation


  - Enhance the auto-index building logic in the chat endpoint
  - Add validation to ensure index is properly created before proceeding
  - Implement retry mechanism for failed index building attempts
  - Add progress tracking and status reporting for index building
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Add comprehensive logging and debugging



  - Add detailed logging throughout the RAG pipeline (index check, search, response)
  - Implement structured logging with timestamps and operation context
  - Create log analysis tools to identify common failure patterns
  - Add performance metrics tracking for each RAG operation
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Enhance debug endpoints functionality







  - Improve the existing debug endpoints with more detailed information
  - Add endpoint to test specific search queries with detailed results
  - Create endpoint to validate user document processing
  - Add endpoint to force index rebuild with progress tracking
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Implement multi-strategy search logic




  - Create search function that tries multiple strategies (exact, partial, fuzzy)
  - Implement address-specific search logic that preserves exact formatting
  - Add fallback search strategies when primary search fails
  - Create search result ranking and validation logic
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4_


- [x] 6. Fix user context and document association






  - Verify that user_id "ok@gmail.com" is properly handled throughout the system
  - Ensure document paths and collection names are correctly generated
  - Add validation to confirm user documents are properly loaded
  - Implement user context debugging tools
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1_

- [x] 7. Implement strict response generation






  - Create response generation logic that only uses retrieved context
  - Add context validation before response generation
  - Implement clear "not found" responses when no relevant documents exist
  - Add response quality validation to prevent hallucination
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
-

- [x] 8. Add search query optimization




  - Improve query processing to preserve exact address formats
  - Implement query preprocessing for better address matching
  - Add query expansion strategies for partial matches
  - Create query validation and sanitization logic
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_




- [x] 9. Enhance error handling and recovery



  - Implement comprehensive error handling for all RAG operations
  - Add automatic recovery mechanisms for common failures


  - Create user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
  - Add system health monitoring and alerting
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.4_

- [x] 10. Create integration tests for RAG fixes



  - Write tests that verify the "84 Mulberry St" query returns correct information
  - Create tests for automatic index building functionality
  - Add tests for multi-strategy search logic
  - Implement tests for error handling and recovery scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 11. Optimize ChromaDB integration



  - Fix any ChromaDB connection or collection management issues
  - Ensure proper user collection isolation and management
  - Add ChromaDB health monitoring and diagnostics
  - Implement efficient document storage and retrieval patterns
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1_

- [x] 12. Add performance monitoring and optimization




  - Implement performance tracking for index building and search operations
  - Add metrics collection for response times and success rates
  - Create performance dashboards and alerting
  - Optimize slow operations identified through monitoring
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.4_
