# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the Okada Leasing Agent's RAG chatbot system that are causing incorrect responses and search failures. The system currently fails to retrieve accurate information about properties that exist in the data, such as "84 Mulberry St", and shows errors like "No fusion retriever available".

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to accurately find and return information about properties that exist in my uploaded documents, so that I get correct property details instead of "not found" messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I query "tell me about 84 Mulberry St" THEN the system SHALL return the correct property information including monthly rent ($80,522) and size (9,567 SF)
2. WHEN a property exists in the user's CSV data THEN the system SHALL find and retrieve that property's information
3. WHEN the system searches for a property THEN it SHALL use the exact address format from the user's query
4. WHEN no exact match is found THEN the system SHALL try alternative search strategies before returning "not found"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically build and maintain my document index, so that I don't need to manually trigger indexing operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a chat request THEN the system SHALL automatically check if my documents are indexed
2. WHEN my documents exist but no index is found THEN the system SHALL automatically build the index
3. WHEN the index building fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN the index is successfully built THEN the system SHALL cache it for subsequent requests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive debugging tools to diagnose RAG system issues, so that I can quickly identify and fix problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints to check index status
2. WHEN testing search functionality THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints to test retrieval directly
3. WHEN diagnosing issues THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about search operations
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to only use information from my actual documents, so that it doesn't hallucinate or make up property information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL only use information found in the retrieved documents
2. WHEN no relevant documents are found THEN the system SHALL clearly state that no information is available
3. WHEN property information is presented THEN it SHALL match exactly what is in the source CSV data
4. WHEN the system cannot find a property THEN it SHALL not invent or guess property details
