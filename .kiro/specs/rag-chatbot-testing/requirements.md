# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive testing framework to validate the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot's ability to accurately retrieve and respond to queries about commercial real estate properties from the HackathonInternalKnowledgeBase.csv dataset. The testing framework will ensure the chatbot can handle various types of property-related queries with accurate, contextual responses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a real estate agent, I want the chatbot to accurately answer basic property information queries, so that I can quickly retrieve property details for clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks about property addresses THEN the system SHALL return accurate address information from the knowledge base
2. WHEN a user queries about property sizes THEN the system SHALL provide correct square footage data
3. WHEN a user asks about rental rates THEN the system SHALL return accurate rent per square foot per year information
4. WHEN a user inquires about monthly or annual rent THEN the system SHALL provide correct calculated rental amounts
5. WHEN a user asks about specific floor or suite information THEN the system SHALL return accurate floor and suite details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a real estate professional, I want the chatbot to handle complex search and filtering queries, so that I can find properties matching specific criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for properties within a price range THEN the system SHALL return all matching properties with accurate pricing
2. WHEN a user filters by property size range THEN the system SHALL return properties within the specified square footage range
3. WHEN a user searches by location or address pattern THEN the system SHALL return relevant properties in that area
4. WHEN a user combines multiple search criteria THEN the system SHALL return properties matching all specified conditions
5. WHEN a user asks for properties above or below certain thresholds THEN the system SHALL apply correct comparison logic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a property manager, I want the chatbot to provide statistical and analytical information, so that I can make informed business decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks for average rental rates THEN the system SHALL calculate and return accurate averages from the dataset
2. WHEN a user requests the most expensive or cheapest properties THEN the system SHALL identify and return correct extremes
3. WHEN a user asks for property count summaries THEN the system SHALL provide accurate counts based on specified criteria
4. WHEN a user requests comparisons between properties THEN the system SHALL provide accurate comparative analysis
5. WHEN a user asks about GCI (Gross Commission Income) information THEN the system SHALL return accurate 3-year GCI projections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a client, I want the chatbot to handle associate and broker information queries, so that I can connect with the right real estate professionals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks about associates for specific properties THEN the system SHALL return accurate associate names and contact information
2. WHEN a user searches for properties by associate name THEN the system SHALL return all properties handled by that associate
3. WHEN a user asks about broker email contacts THEN the system SHALL provide correct email addresses
4. WHEN a user inquires about associate workload THEN the system SHALL calculate accurate property counts per associate
5. WHEN a user asks about team compositions THEN the system SHALL return accurate associate team information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the chatbot to handle edge cases and error scenarios gracefully, so that users receive helpful responses even when queries cannot be fully satisfied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks about non-existent properties THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate "not found" messages
2. WHEN a user provides ambiguous queries THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification or provide multiple relevant options
3. WHEN a user asks questions outside the knowledge base scope THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the limitation
4. WHEN a user provides malformed queries THEN the system SHALL attempt to interpret intent and provide helpful responses
5. WHEN the system cannot retrieve relevant information THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations and suggest alternative queries

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want comprehensive test coverage of all data fields and query types, so that I can ensure the chatbot's reliability across all use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing property address queries THEN the system SHALL be tested against all unique addresses in the dataset
2. WHEN testing numerical data queries THEN the system SHALL be validated against size, rent, and financial calculations
3. WHEN testing associate information THEN the system SHALL be verified against all associate names and email patterns
4. WHEN testing complex multi-field queries THEN the system SHALL be validated for accurate cross-referencing
5. WHEN testing response consistency THEN the system SHALL provide consistent answers for equivalent queries asked in different ways
